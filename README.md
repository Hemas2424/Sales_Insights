<h1> Here is the step by step Process which I have gone Through</h1>
<h3>Step 1: Analyze the Dataset</h3>
<pre>
  -->Review the dataset to understand its structure, fields, and content.
  -->Identify key metrics (e.g., sales, profit, customer count) and dimensions (e.g., region, product, category) for analysis.
</pre>
  

<h3>Step 2: Check for Errors in the Dataset</h3>
<pre>
  -->Look for missing values, duplicates, or inconsistent data entries.
  -->Identify and resolve data type mismatches (e.g., text stored as numbers or dates in incorrect formats).
</pre>


<h3>Step 3: Clean the Dataset</h3>
<pre>
  -->Handle missing values using appropriate methods (e.g., imputation or deletion).
  -->Remove duplicates and correct inconsistent or inaccurate entries.
  -->Standardize formats (e.g., date formats, currency).
</pre>

<h3>Step 4: Import the Dataset into Power BI</h3>

<pre>
  -->Connect Power BI directly to the dataset in its current format (e.g., Excel, CSV, or MySQL database).
  -->If using a MySQL database, establish a live or direct import connection to ensure data access.
  -->Validate the data after importing it into Power BI to ensure consistency with the original source.
</pre>

<h3>Step 5: Clean Data in Power BI</h3>

  Use Power Query to perform additional cleaning:
  <pre>
  -->Remove unnecessary columns.
  -->Rename columns for better clarity.
  -->Apply transformations (e.g., splitting columns, pivoting/unpivoting data)
  </pre>

<h3>Step 6: Model the Data</h3>

  <pre>
  -->Define relationships between tables in Power BI (e.g., linking sales, customers, and products).
  -->Create calculated columns or measures (e.g., total sales, profit margin) as needed for analysis.
  </pre>

<h3>Step 7: Analyze the Data Model</h3>

  <pre>
  -->Verify the relationships and ensure that data aggregations (e.g., sum, average) are accurate.
  -->Test sample queries to validate the model.
  </pre>

<h3>Step 8: Create the Dashboard</h3>

  <pre>
  -->Drag and drop visuals (e.g., bar charts, line graphs, KPIs, slicers) to represent the data insights effectively.
  -->Use filters, slicers, and drill-throughs for interactivity.
  -->Customize the layout, colors, and labels for clarity and aesthetics.
  </pre>

<h3>Step 9: Review and Publish</h3>

<pre>
  -->Verify that all visuals are accurate and meet the requirements.
  -->Share or publish the dashboard for stakeholders to access insights.
</pre>
